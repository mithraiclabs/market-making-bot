# PsyOptions Market Making Bot
This repository is a public market making bot for the PsyOptions ecosystem. 

The MVP is supposed to be really basic. It should be a simple bot that can be open sourced for 
other market makers have a good starting point.

The milestones for the MVP are as follows:
1. Create AnchorPy bindings for the Psy American protocol
2. Add very basic pricing model (the core code will be open sourced for other market makers to use, so no need to get fancy and use any proprietary strats)
3. Quote two ways on the PsyOptions/Serum order book
